# Hello Worlds in C++
This repo shows different ways of doing a Hello World. Doing so with good practices in mind.

## Information
I develop with Linux so in each project, the output files are without extensions. The executables of Windows are `.EXE` and Linux are `.` (with no extension)

## 1) Hello World
This is a casual hello world with only one source file.
